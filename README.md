# Introduction
A-Alpha Bio is a company, located in Seattle, WA. Based on their company website, they have AlphaSeq and AlphaBind two platforms (https://www.aalphabio.com/technology/). This company was founded based on the founder David Younger's 2017 PNAS paper. In order to understand more about this company, I read his paper, understood the methodology and original codes to reproduce the figures.

# Methodology
This study reprogrammed yeast mating and used it as a high-throughput method to screen protein-protein interactions. He first engineered yeast strains (MATa and MATÎ± haploid cells) to show a log-linear relationship between mating efficiency and protein binding strength.

After that, they design libraries with barcode technology and NGS analysis to screen the protein interactions involving six prosurvival BCL2 homologs and nine de novo binding proteins.
