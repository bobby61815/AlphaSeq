# Introduction
A-Alpha Bio is a company located in Seattle, WA. Based on their company website, they have AlphaSeq and AlphaBind, two platforms [1]. This company was founded based on its founder David Younger's 2017 PNAS paper [2]. In order to better understand this company, I read his paper, methodology, and original codes to reproduce the figures.  

# Methodology
This study reprogrammed yeast mating and used this as a high-throughput method to screen protein-protein interactions. He first engineered yeast strains (MATa and MATÎ± haploid cells) to show a log-linear relationship between mating efficiency and protein binding strength.

After that, they designed libraries with barcode technology and used NGS analysis to screen the protein interactions involving six prosurvival BCL2 homologs and nine de novo binding proteins. 

By using this approach, they can characterize the binding strength between designed protein libraries and multiple target proteins in a high-throughput approach.
